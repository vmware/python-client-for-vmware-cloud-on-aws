It is a Python tool developed for VMware Cloud on AWS. PyVMC was created by Nicolas Vibert and Matt Dreyer.

## Do I need to know Python?
No! You can simply use it to consume and manage your VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC (Software-Defined Data Center). 

## Is it officially supported by VMware?
Sorry but no, this is a community-based effort. Use it at your own risk. It has extensively been tested though and we'll endeavour to fix any bugs.

Versions 1.9 and 1.10. I don't guarantee support with previous versions.
