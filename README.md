## Overview

# pyVMC
Welcome to the Python Client for VMware Cloud on AWS !

## What is the Python Client for VMware Cloud on AWS ? 
It is a Python tool developed for VMware Cloud on AWS. PyVMC was created by Nicolas Vibert and Matt Dreyer.

## What are the pre-requisites for PyVMC ?
- Python3 installed on your machine
- a VMware Cloud on AWS account

## How do I use PyVMC ?
- clone repo
- install dependencies
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- copy config.ini.example to config.ini and add your own token
- Edit the config.ini with your own SDDC ID,  Organization (Org) ID and your access token.

## Do I need to know Python?
No! You can simply use it to consume and manage your VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC (Software-Defined Data Center). 

## Is it officially supported by VMware?
Sorry but no, this is a community-based effort. Use it at your own risk. It has extensively been tested though and we'll endeavour to fix any bugs.

## Which version of VMware Cloud on AWS has it been tested against?
Versions 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.14, and 1.15. We don't guarantee support with previous versions. 
I will, however, endeavour to verify compatibility as we release new versions.

## What if I find a bug or need a new feature?
Please raise it on GitHub and we will look into it.

## Where can I find documentation about VMware Cloud on AWS:
Please check the online documentation:
